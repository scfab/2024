  title: 'From Byzantine Replication to Blockchains: Consensus is only the Beginning'
  abstract: 'The success of bitcoin and other blockchains lead to a renewed interest in Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) consensus protocols, with many recent contributions both from industry and academia. However, there are few long-standing issues with the practical deployment of these protocols (e.g., their resilience to evolving threats) that remain mostly unaddressed. In the first part of this talk, I’ll discuss some subtle issues that arise when using BFT replication protocols for implementing blockchains. After that, I’ll outline how these protocols can be made robust against changing network conditions and new common vulnerabilities on the replicas software by monitoring the environment and employing risk management and weighted replication.'

  title: 'ON THE NEED FOR FORMAL AND EFFECTIVE INTERNAL GOVERNANCE MECHANISMS IN PERMISSIONLESS BLOCKCHAINS'
  abstract: 'With the birth and rise of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, and its advanced variant Ethereum offering added functionalities such as a smart-contracts, the concept of blockchain has been popularised. Blockchains are software artefacts that bring the promise of facilitating radically new governmental and commercial applications, mainly thanks to their nature as trust-enabling tools, to the extent that commentators have claimed that improved societal organisation forms will be possible thanks to them, where human corruption and instability will be reduced to a minimum. Taking into consideration this ar-reaching goal, we perform a critical examination of the following question: can existing blockchain communities mechanisms and procedures for collective decision-making (which we refer to as internal blockchain governance), live up to those ambitions? By building on scholar literature on governance and law, we argue that if permissionless blockchain systems do not build internal governance mechanisms founded on formalised and effective social mechanisms, then they are unlikely to be taken up at scale as a tool for social coordination, and are thus likely to remain, at best, a marginal technology. This is based on joint work with Prof Karen Yeung, University of Birmingham.'

  title: 'BLOCKS OF TRUST – USING THE BLOCKCHAIN TO BUILD TRUST IN IOT'
  abstract: 'The Internet of Things (IoT) carries a big promise, to improve our lives through numerous connected devices. At the same time, it also presents new security challenges. One of the biggest challenges for the Internet of Things (IoT) is the establishing of trust as the traditional PKI model does not fit with the heterogeneous IoT ecosystem. Another big challenge arises from the questionable security of many of these devices that are becoming targets of choice for numerous exploits. Exploits that leads to compromising the networks to which they connect. In this talk we will show how the blockchain can be used to build a new distributed trust model that answers these challenges.'

    title: 'Software Architecture and Engineering for Blockchain Applications'
    abstract: 'Blockchain is a novel distributed ledger technology, which has attracted a wide range of interests for building the next generation of applications in almost all industry sectors. The broad range of applications is made possible by smart contracts, which transform a blockchain system into a general compute platform.
For this new paradigm and technology platform, we investigated its impact on software architecture and engineering practices. Our starting point for this investigation was the question “what do architects and engineers need to know about blockchain to make good use of it?” In this keynote, I will cover the main insights from this work, recently summarized in the book “Architecture for Blockchain Applications”, Springer, 2019.'
